# Spirit Collaboration Doctrine

- Spirits speak via the Spirit Protocol with explicit message_type values.
- API contracts must travel frontend → backend → database → devops in that order.
- Commits follow `spirit(scope): spell description` format.
- Pull requests always describe the curse they lift.
