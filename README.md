# NecroCode: Kiroween Skeleton Crew

NecroCode summons a theme-aware squad of AI spirits from plain job descriptions. This repository hosts the core framework plus two sample workspaces that demonstrate how each summoned spirit collaborates through the Spirit Protocol.

## Structure
- `.kiro/` – Specs, hooks, and steering docs that guide the summoning rituals.
- `framework/` – Orchestrator, spirit implementations, messaging fabric, and workspace utilities.
- `workspace1/` – Real-time collaboration crypt.
- `workspace2/` – IoT dashboard crypt.

Each workspace is an independent Git repository managed by the Necromancer to keep every spirit focused on its craft.
